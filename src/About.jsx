        Particularly if you have an interesting backstory about your company or
        how you developed your product, it's great to share it with the
        audience. People respond to authenticity and real stories. Your first
        blog post is a great time to open up with a <a className="red" href="https://optinmonster.com/website-welcome-message-examples/" target="_blank">“Welcome”</a> theme.
